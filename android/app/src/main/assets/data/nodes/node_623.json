{"body":"<p>A core component of cascade analysis - of both aggregate and individual-level data - is the disaggregation of indicators by specific geographical and sociodemographic subpopulations or important patient subgroups. This type of analysis enables managers to address issues of both programme performance and equity in terms of access and service quality. In the interest of improving programme performance, the fastest way to achieve overall programme targets lies in identifying and addressing the barriers for the most underserved groups. Disaggregated analysis enables these subpopulations to be identified, which can be described either by geography (for example, region or province, district or county or facility) age, sex, key population and other important characteristics that require differentiated management or services (for example, pregnant women and people with both TB and HIV). Indicators include disaggregation by priority population or population-specific indicators that reflect the relative contribution of these groups to the epidemic and monitoring the performance of programme services for these groups. To achieve programme effectiveness and equity, programmes must commit to services reaching all people in need and to leaving no one behind. Routine assessment of equity in service delivery and quality across groups is fundamental to measuring and tracking these commitments.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>All data collected must be strictly treated as confidential, especially for members of key populations, who face significant stigma and discrimination. All data should be stored securely, and the staff collecting and storing data should be properly trained to maintain patient (or client) confidentiality.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"8.3 Data collection and disaggregation","nid":623,"vid":2674,"created":1632393963,"changed":1632395690,"field_content_type":{"tid":1,"name":"Content","class":"content"}}
