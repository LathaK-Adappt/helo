Although the evidence for the efficacy of preventive treatment for children receiving ART is limited, it is biologically plausible given the evidence of additive effects for adults living with HIV receiving ART. Thus, TB preventive treatment is recommended for children living with HIV <em>(38).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Implementation considerations<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>TB preventive treatment for people living with HIV should be a core component of the HIV package of care and should be primarily the responsibility of national HIV and AIDS programmes and HIV service providers <em>(51).<\/em> In situations where these tests are not available, TB preventive treatment should not be withheld from eligible people if active disease has been excluded on clinical grounds alone, and chest radiography should not be a requirement for initiating preventive treatment.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Ruling out active TB disease<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Excluding active TB disease before initiating preventive treatment is one of the critical steps in the latent TB infection care pathway. For adults and adolescents living with HIV, the four-symptom screen - current cough, fever, weight loss and night sweats - is useful for ruling out active TB, regardless of ART use. <em>WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis: Module 1: prevention: tuberculosis preventive treatment (38)<\/em> includes an algorithm for latent TB infection testing and TB preventive treatment for individuals at risk.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>TB preventive treatment options<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>TB preventive treatment for an infection with strains presumed to be drug-susceptible can be broadly categorized into two types: monotherapy with isoniazid for at least six months (isoniazid preventive therapy) and treatment with regimens containing a rifamycin (rifampicin or rifapentine). Isoniazid preventive therapy has been the most widely used type of TB preventive treatment, but the shorter duration of rifamycin regimens presents a clear advantage <em>(38).<\/em> Preventive treatment for multidrug-resistant TB requires a different regimen using a fluoroquinolone or other second-line agents <em>(38).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>WHO has included both recommendations for regimens containing isoniazid or rifamycins in guidance since 2015 <em>(62).<\/em> Previous WHO guidance included a strong recommendation for TB preventive treatment alternatives to six months of isoniazid monotherapy based on evidence of low to high certainty. In 2019, WHO made two new conditional recommendations for daily rifapentine plus isoniazid for one month and daily rifampicin monotherapy for four months in all settings. These new recommendations are based on low- to moderate-certainty evidence. In addition, instead of a previous range of 3-4 months, WHO now recommends a duration of three months for daily isoniazid plus rifampicin and of four months of daily rifampicin alone to reflect the usual length of time for which these regimens are currently used.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Moreover, three previous recommendations on using six months of isoniazid monotherapy, three months of daily isoniazid plus rifampicin for people younger than 15 years and daily rifapentine plus isoniazid for three months in high-TB-prevalence settings that featured separately in previous guidance are now proposed as alternative options. The revised recommendation makes all latent TB infection options applicable to all settings <em>(38).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Implementation considerations<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The recommendation to give at least 36 months of daily isoniazid monotherapy to people living with HIV in high-TB-transmission settings is conditional and based on evidence that longer-term isoniazid preventive therapy significantly adds benefit to ART. The efficacy, safety and convenience of repeated treatment with shorter rifapentine regimens is being studied among people living with HIV in such settings. WHO defines high-TB-transmission settings as those with a high frequency of individuals with undetected or undiagnosed active TB or in which people with infectious TB are present and there is a high risk of TB transmission, but the national authorities should establish the definition. Testing for latent TB infection is not a prerequisite for TB preventive treatment for people living with HIV, but using it is encouraged because people who are positive on a tuberculin skin test have a greater protective benefit from TB preventive treatment. People living with HIV with a negative tuberculin skin test should not receive 36 months of daily isoniazid preventive therapy.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The benefits of three months of daily isoniazid plus rifampicin for infants and children younger than 15 years outweigh the harm, given its safety profile, the higher rate of completion compared with isoniazid monotherapy and the availability of child-friendly, fixed-dose combinations of rifampicin and isoniazid.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>All the treatment options can be self-administered. <em>WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis: Module 1: prevention: tuberculosis preventive treatment (38)<\/em> outlines the recommended dosages of medicines for TB preventive treatment.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Drug-drug interactions<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Regimens containing rifamycins should be prescribed with caution to people living with HIV who are receiving ART because of potential drug-drug interactions. These regimens should not be administered to people receiving PIs or NVP, including HIV-exposed infants receiving TB preventive treatment. Rifampicin can decrease the concentrations of ATV, DRV, LPV and other PIs. No dose adjustment is required when rifampicin is co-administered with EFV. The dose of DTG needs to be increased to 50 mg twice daily when given together with rifampicin and twice daily dosing should be continued for an additional two weeks following stop of rifampicin use <em>(63).<\/em> Results from a recent Phase 1\/2 trial of daily rifapentine plus isoniazid for three months and DTG for adults living with HIV reported good tolerability and viral load suppression. However, the Guideline Development Group stressed the continued need for studying the pharmacokinetics of daily rifapentine plus isoniazid for three months concomitantly with other medicines, especially ART.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"6.4.4 Prevention","nid":561,"vid":2722,"created":1632147613,"changed":1632682120,"field_content_type":{"tid":1,"name":"Content","class":"content"}}
