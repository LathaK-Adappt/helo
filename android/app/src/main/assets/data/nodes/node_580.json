WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, followed by continued breastfeeding with appropriate complementary foods for up to two years or beyond. The evidence for the long-term benefits of longer durations of breastfeeding for both maternal and child health outcomes, including child development and preventing noncommunicable diseases, highlights the relevance of supporting breastfeeding in high-, middle- and low-income settings.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>HIV infection both directly affects the nutritional status of women and children living with HIV and indirectly affects them by altering household food security and through inappropriate choices of infant-feeding practices.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In 2016, based on revisions to the ARV drug guidelines, a greater evidence base and programmatic experience, WHO updated its guidance on HIV and infant feeding. The recommendations and good practice statements are detailed below. For guidance on what to feed infants when mothers stop breastfeeding and conditions needed to safely formula feed should this be the mother's choice, see the 2016 guidelines on HIV and infant feeding <em>(266).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Implementing the following recommendations requires appropriately training and developing the capacity of health-care workers to supply them with the necessary skills and job aids and provide adequate supervision and oversight. Programmes need to be systematically monitored to ensure success and to identify and document challenges to implementation.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Clinical considerations for supporting mothers with HIV to breastfeed<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Key clinical and implementation considerations for breastfeeding by mothers living with HIV while receiving ART include:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>communicating clearly and effectively the effectiveness of ART and suppressing viral loads in reducing the postnatal transmission risks through breastfeeding to health-care workers, mothers and the community;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>communicating the importance of viral load monitoring during breastfeeding to ensure that suppression is maintained;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>highlighting the value of breastfeeding for the health, development and survival of mothers living with HIV and their children when the mother is receiving and adhering to ART and has suppressed viral loads;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>implementing and sustaining specific interventions such as an integrated approach to delivering follow-up care for the mother and child as part of basic maternal, newborn and child health services (including immunization and other well-child services) to improve postpartum follow-up of mother-infant pairs and support breastfeeding practices and ART adherence;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>emphasizing postnatal prophylaxis for infants: infants of mothers who are receiving ART and are breastfeeding should receive six weeks of infant prophylaxis with daily NVP, or if they are considered at high risk, enhanced infant prophylaxis using AZT and NVP for six weeks followed by either AZT and NVP or NVP alone for an additional six weeks (see section 4.4.6); and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>linking the receipt of infant HIV testing and results with appropriate infant feeding counselling: infants living with HIV should continue breastfeeding until 24 months or longer.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>For infants who acquire HIV despite interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission, exposure to drugs through breastfeeding affects drug resistance and toxicity and may affect the success of ART regimens for the child (see section 4.8 on toxicity monitoring and drug resistance).<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Implementation considerations<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Investment and action to protect, promote and support breastfeeding in the general population should remain priorities of health ministries, nongovernmental organizations and other partners in all settings. HIV and maternal, newborn and child health programmes need to give priority to integrating ART services, including adherence counselling and support for infant and young child feeding, in all settings. These programmes and partner agencies need to ensure training and developing the capacity of health-care workers to implement the recommendations. Programmes and partner agencies should collect data to monitor the duration of breastfeeding by mothers living with HIV in addition to adherence to ART and the rates of retention in care of mothers and infants. Such data should be used to improve the quality of service delivery at district and local clinics.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Community and health facility approaches to support improved infant feeding practices include:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>combining group education with individual counselling sessions;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>building the skills and competencies of health-care workers to deliver infant feeding counselling;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>involving fathers and other family members;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>involving community health workers and trained health-care workers; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>integrating programmes for preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV with access to ART.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>National authorities need to create and sustain an enabling environment that encourages appropriate feeding practices for all infants and young children while scaling up interventions to reduce HIV transmission <em>(266).<\/em> As stated in the 2010 WHO guidelines on HIV and infant feeding <em>(267),<\/em> health services need to support mothers living with HIV in their chosen feeding practices even when these are inconsistent with nationally recommended practices. This principle is still endorsed by WHO and remains relevant.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In all settings, implementing recommendations for mothers living with HIV should be contextualized first by the optimal infant feeding practice recommended for all mothers and infants: exclusively breastfeeding for six months and then introducing appropriate complementary foods and continuing breastfeeding for 24 months or beyond. When implementing recommendations for mothers living with HIV, national health authorities need to clearly communicate the hierarchy of what is ideal and how the recommendations for mothers living with HIV are specific to their circumstances.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Simple, consistent messaging is essential to support breastfeeding in the general population, including mothers living with HIV. Programmes should develop clear messaging that addresses views and concerns related to previous recommendations to avoid misunderstandings among health-care workers, mothers living with HIV and the general population.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In settings in which national authorities recommend replacement feeding for mothers living with HIV, similar coordinated support can probably improve the safety of replacement feeding practices.
