{"body":"<p>WHO recommends differentiated HIV testing service delivery approaches in a people-centred approach to address the needs of a variety of population groups, contexts and epidemic settings (Chapter 7 provides further details on people-centred care and differentiated service for HIV treatment). It is essential for countries to provide a strategic mix of WHO-recommended differentiated HIV testing service delivery approaches (Box 2.1). These include facility-based testing, community-based testing, HIV self-testing, partner services including provider-assisted referral and social network-based approaches. Trained lay providers and peers can now often provide an HIV diagnosis within a single visit in a health facility or community setting using rapid diagnostic tests.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Programmes need to routinely review and use their data to select and optimize the implementation of HIV testing service delivery approaches to reach populations and geographical settings with the largest proportion of people living with HIV who do not know their status.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>See Chapter 5 of the <em>Consolidated guidelines on HIV testing services, 2019 (1), <\/em>which describes in detail the service delivery approaches for HIV testing services.<\/p>","title":"2.4 HIV testing service delivery approaches","nid":485,"vid":2006,"created":1630676059,"changed":1630935726,"field_content_type":{"tid":1,"name":"Content","class":"content"}}
