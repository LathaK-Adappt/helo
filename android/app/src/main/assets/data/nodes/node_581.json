{"body":"<h5>Introduction<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>An essential component of comprehensive clinical management for people living with HIV is the palliative care to prevent and relieve suffering and optimize quality of life<em>(269).<\/em>Common problems among people living with HIV that are managed by palliative care include pain and other physical symptoms related to HIV infection or its treatment; mood disorders and psychosocial distress related to stigmatization and poverty; and spiritual distress. Successful ART has resulted in a growing population of ageing people living with HIV, many of whom have multimorbidity, meaning that the people who need palliative care are changing. Person-centred palliative care must value people's social networks, promote quality of life and reform structurally to improve how people experience interacting with the health-care system<em>(270).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Need for palliative care among people living with HIV<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><strong>Epidemiology<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>An estimated 12.8 million of the 38 million people living with HIV need palliative care<em>(271).<\/em>This includes nearly all the 690 000 people living with HIV who died in 2019<em>(272).<\/em>The great majority of people living with HIV who would benefit from palliative care are not at the end of life but are living with HIV and its comorbidities and biopsychosocial consequences. More than 90% of the total need for palliative care among people living with HIV is in low- and middle-income countries; among children, HIV represents about 30% of worldwide palliative care need<em>(271).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><strong>Unrelieved suffering<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Recent estimates of the burden of serious health-related suffering found that people living with HIV experienced almost 194 million days of serious health-related suffering<em>(273).<\/em>Symptoms of health-related suffering are highly prevalent from diagnosis and persist alongside treatment, with the prevalence of anxiety (28%) and depression (34%) among people living with HIV receiving ART being higher than among people with other chronic conditions such as cancer, diabetes and multiple sclerosis<em>(274).<\/em>These burdens are reflected in data showing that people living with HIV have poorer quality of life than the general population<em>(275).<\/em>Among people with AIDS, 43-95% report fatigue, 82% anorexia, 30-98% pain, 41-57% nausea and vomiting, 43-62% breathlessness, 40-74% insomnia and 29-53% diarrhoea<em>(276).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Pain profoundly affects quality of life, and people living with HIV identify pain control as essential to enable a \"life worth living\"<em>(277).<\/em>Uncontrolled symptoms have severe clinical and public health implications, including poor adherence to ART<em>(278),<\/em>treatment switching<em>(279),<\/em>viral rebound<em>(280),<\/em>poorer quality of life<em>(281),<\/em>suicidal ideation and days out of work or education<em>(282).<\/em>Spiritual suffering is also burdensome among people living with HIV, especially in advanced HIV disease, when spiritual well-being can become people's primary concern<em>(283,284).<\/em>Progressive illness in low- and middle-income countries places a huge mental, social, economic, physical and spiritual burden on people living with HIV and the largely female caregiving members of families<em>(276,285).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Children and young people have some symptoms and concerns in common with adults but also face specific concerns<em>(286).<\/em>The palliative care needs of children and young people in sub-Saharan Africa include physical concerns (such as pain and symptom distress); psychosocial concerns (such as family and social relationships), ability to engage with age-appropriate activities (such as play and attending school); existential concerns (such as worry about death and loss of ambitions); and health-care quality (such as child- and adolescent-friendly services). Priority psychosocial concerns and health service factors vary by age<em>(287,288).<\/em>It isincreasingly recognized that children living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries have multi-system chronic comorbidities despite ART<em>(289).<\/em>Thus, prompt diagnosis and treatment are a priority alongside managing pain and symptoms.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><strong>Ageing and comorbidities<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The successes of ART have led to improved survival and quality of life, but an increasing proportion of deaths among people living with HIV is attributable to chronic noncommunicable diseases in many settings<em>(290).<\/em>By 2030, people living with HIV are estimated to be likely to have an average of three noncommunicable diseases<em>(291).<\/em>A longitudinal study of mortality among people living with HIV in the United Kingdom found that only 58% of the deaths were from AIDS-defining illness, 19% cancer, 19% cardiovascular diseases, 18% infections, 12% liver disease, 6% substance misuse, 5% suicide, 5% accidents and 17% other causes (more than one option and the total therefore exceeds 100%)<em>(292).<\/em>In a multisite study from Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Viet Nam, 47% of deaths among adults and children with HIV were non-AIDS infections<em>(293).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Palliative care in HIV treatment<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><strong>Definition of palliative care<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>WHO defines palliative care as the prevention and relief of suffering of adults and children and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness. These problems include physical, mental, social and spiritual suffering among the people with life-threatening illness and the mental, social and spiritual suffering of family members<em>(294).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Palliative care:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>entails early identification and accurate assessment and treatment of these problems;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>enhances quality of life, promotes dignity and comfort and may also positively influence the course of illness;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>provides accompaniment for the person with life-threatening illness and family throughout the course of illness and for bereaved family members;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>should be integrated with and complement prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of HIV infection and associated conditions;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>is applicable early in the course of illness in conjunction with ART and other therapies intended to prolong life;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>is especially important near the end of life when the disease treatments may no longer be beneficial or desired by the person with life-threatening illness;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>seeks to mitigate the pathogenic effects of poverty on people with life-threatening illness and their families and to protect them from financial hardship caused by illness or disability;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>should be applied by health-care workers at all levels of health-care systems, including primary care providers, generalists and specialists in HIV or infectious disease;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>encourages active involvement by communities and community members; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>should be accessible at all levels of health-care systems and in individuals' homes.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>Palliative care is applicable from the point of diagnosis, enabling people with life-threatening illness and their families to benefit from a holistic, people-centred approach focusing on individual preferences and priorities and controlling pain and symptoms. For people living with HIV at the end of life, symptoms may worsen, priorities change and decisions about place of death and treatment withdrawal become important<em>(276).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Policy and human rights<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Palliative care is recognized as a human right<em>(295)<\/em>and an essential component of integrated, people-centred health services. The World Health Assembly resolution on palliative care (resolution 67.19, 2014) calls for palliative care to be \"integrated throughout the life-course\" and recognizes it to be \"fundamental to improving the quality of life, well-being, comfort and human dignity of individuals, being an effective person-centred health service\"<em>(296).<\/em>The most recent version of the WHO goals for universal health coverage calls for the \"full spectrum of essential, quality health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care across the life-course\"<em>(297).<\/em>WHO also calls for palliative care as an essential component of a comprehensive package of care for people living with HIV because of the variety of symptoms they can experience.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Although evidence consistently identifies that people with life-threatening illness prefer home death<em>(298-300),<\/em>a study across 11 countries found that people living with HIV are more likely to die in a hospital than people with cancer<em>(301).<\/em>Health policy should enable the preferences for care at the end of life to be honoured.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Evidence also indicates that individual members of key populations have a greater need for palliative care and worse bereavement outcomes than others<em>(302-304)<\/em>but may be excluded from palliative care services<em>(305,306).<\/em>Access to palliative care for children lags behind that of adults, and equitable access to palliative care that reflects children's specific social, education and developmental needs is essential<em>(286,307).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of palliative care<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>A systematic review found that home palliative care and inpatient hospice care significantly improve outcomes in the domains of pain and symptom control, anxiety, insight and spiritual well-being<em>(308).<\/em>Evidence from a randomized controlled trial of integrated palliative care for people living with HIV accessing ART in Kenya suggests that a simple intervention of brief training and using a holistic person-centred assessment tool with a proforma care plan and clinical mentorship improved quality of life, mental health, psychosocial concerns and stigma<em>(309-313).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The available evidence suggests that palliative care in low- and middle-income countries saves money for health-care systems<em>(314).<\/em>Implementing a hospital-based palliative care team in a hospital in South Africa improved the proportion dying at home and reduced admissions and length of stay and costs per patient<em>(315).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Programme considerations<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><strong>Essential package of care<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>WHO has recommended an essential package of palliative care comprising four interventions: a list of safe, effective, inexpensive, off-patent and widely available medicines; simple and inexpensive equipment; basic social supports; and the human resources needed to provide the medicines, equipment and social supports effectively and safely (Table 6.7)<em>(273,316,317).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><strong>Essential medicines<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The list of medicines in the essential package of palliative care is based on the 2019 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for palliative care for adults and children<em>(110,318).<\/em>Medicines were selected based on their indispensability to prevent or relieve the most common types of suffering of people living with HIV and people with other serious illnesses, the ability of clinicians with basic palliative care training to prescribe them safely and their balance of clinical effectiveness, safety, ease of use, low cost and global market accessibility<em>(316,319).<\/em>Morphine, in oral fast-release and injectable formulations, is indispensable for treating pain and refractoryterminal dyspnoea. Efforts to prevent the diversion of morphine and other controlled medicines should not result in inappropriate regulatory barriers to access to such medicines<em>(319,320).<\/em>The 2020 WHO guidelines on managing chronic pain among children<em>(321)<\/em>also state that access to pain management is a fundamental human right, and governments must \"guarantee essential medicines, which include, among others, opioid analgesics as part of their minimum core obligations under the right to health\".<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><strong>Non-pharmaceutical management<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The availability of medicines for controlling pain and symptoms for people living with HIV is essential. In addition to pharmaceutical management, self-management may empower people living with HIV because of undertreatment stigma and challenges in accessing clinical support when pain is wrongly attributed<em>(277).<\/em>A systematic review found that self-management interventions delivered online, face-to-face or group-based comprising booklets, leaflets or manuals are effective in improving the relief of pain and physical symptoms among people living with HIV<em>(322).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><strong>Clinical education<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>WHO recommends that all health-care providers be trained in at least basic palliative care because of the range of health-care providers who have a role in delivery, including community and primary care providers, paediatricians and HIV specialists<em>(313).<\/em>Basic HIV palliative care training should aim to create competencies in assessing and relieving pain and other physical symptoms, common types of mental distress such as anxiety and depression and common types of social suffering such as stigmatization, abandonment and extreme poverty. The training also should generate competencies in empathetic and culturally sensitive communication with people with life-threatening illness, medical ethics, advance care planning, interdisciplinary teamwork, end-of-life care, bereavement support and self-care. Outlines for such curricula are available<em>(313,316).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The level of training that different types of health-care providers should require is as follows<em>(316):<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>basic palliative care training (duration: 30-40 hours) for all health-care providers working at the primary care or community level who care for people living with HIV; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>intermediate-level palliative care training (duration: 60-80 hours) for health-care professionals specializing in such fields as HIV management, infectious disease, tropical medicine, TB, oncology, haematology, family medicine, internal medicine and critical care.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p><strong>Place of care<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The guidance for planning palliative care services states that people living with HIV should have access to palliative care at all levels of health-care systems and in the home<em>(313).<\/em>Central-level hospitals that care for people living with HIV should have a palliative care team comprising one or more doctors (ideally a palliative care specialist), nurses and a social worker or psychologist that provide inpatient and outpatient care and advice and support for clinicians providing palliative care at lower levels. District hospitals should have one or more doctors and nurses with at least basic palliative care training and a social worker who provides inpatient and outpatient palliative care as one official responsibility. In hospitals, health-care providers should initiate palliative care for people in need, relieve any type of suffering as completely as possible and create discharge plans for people returning home at the end of life to protect them from suffering. This may entail communicating with health-care providers at the community level<em>(313).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Primary health-care centres would benefit from having at least one health-care worker with at least basic palliative care training. The tasks could include initiating palliative care and planning treatment for people living with HIV with uncomplicated needs, continuing palliative care begun in a hospital, surveillance for uncontrolled symptoms with help from community health workers, home visits when necessary and feasible, prescription refills and referral to higher levels as needed. If possible, primary health-care centres can provide inpatient hospice care for people living with HIV whose symptoms are well controlled but are unable to be cared for adequately at home. Community health workers can be taught in a few hours to recognize uncontrolled suffering among people at home, and simple valid person-centred outcome measures can enable lay community health workers to identify palliative care symptoms and concerns and communicate this information rapidly using mobile health technologies to palliative care teams<em>(323).<\/em>Health-care professionals should supervise community health workers who visit people who need palliative care. Person-centred HIV care delivered in the community by trained health-care professionals can improve outcomes in all four dimensions of well-being (physical, mental, social and spiritual) and retention in care<em>(324)<\/em>and is a core principle of WHO's public health approach.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><strong>Social support<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Social support is a basic component of the early palliative care consultation and should be accessible for anyone who needs palliative care and for their main caregiver in instances of extreme poverty<em>(325-327).<\/em>Given that extreme poverty is both a cause and an effect of HIV infection, it is crucial that meaningful social support be accessible<em>(325).<\/em>Such social support includes transport vouchers, cash payments, food packages and other types of in-kind support<em>(326,327).<\/em>In most cases, funding for social support should come not from health-care budgets but from antipoverty or social welfare programmes. Thus, implementing all aspects of the full essential package of palliative care requires intersectoral coordination<em>(317).<\/em><\/p>","title":"6.17 Palliative care","nid":581,"vid":2471,"created":1632151161,"changed":1632227728,"field_content_type":{"tid":1,"name":"Content","class":"content"}}
