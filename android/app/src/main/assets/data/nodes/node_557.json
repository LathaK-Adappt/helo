{"body":"<h5>Background<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>An estimated one fourth of the world's population is infected with TB, and about 5-10% of those infected develop active TB disease in their lifetime. The risk for active TB disease after infection depends on several factors, the most important being the person's immune status <em>(38).<\/em> People living with HIV are 15-22 times more likely to develop active TB than people without HIV, and TB is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV worldwide <em>(39,40).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>WHO has developed and published consolidated guidelines on TB in four modules, designed as living documents that will be updated as new information becomes available:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><strong>Module 1:<\/strong> Prevention <em>(38);<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><strong>Module 2:<\/strong> Screening: systematic screening for tuberculosis disease <em>(41);<\/em> <strong>Module 3:<\/strong> Diagnosis: rapid diagnostics for tuberculosis detection <em>(42);<\/em> and <strong>Module 4:<\/strong> Treatment: drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment <em>(43).<\/em> Key information from each module is summarized below.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>WHO is developing new consolidated guidelines on managing TB among children and adolescents. These guidelines, along with an operational handbook, are expected to be released at the end of 2021; they will consolidate all TB-related recommendations relevant for children (0-9 years old) and adolescents (10-19 years old) in TB, HIV and nutrition guidelines. New evidence will be reviewed on diagnostic approaches (using treatment decision algorithms and using Xpert\u00ae Ultra in gastric aspirate and stool specimens), treatment shortening for drug-susceptible TB, treatment of drug-resistant TB, treatment of TB meningitis and models of care (decentralization and family-centred, integrated approaches) among children and adolescents, including those living with HIV.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"6.4 Tuberculosis","nid":557,"vid":2734,"created":1632146915,"changed":1632909238,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content-Menulist","class":"content-menulist"}}
