Priorities may need to be set among demand creation approaches, depending on the setting, focus population and available resources, as part of a strategy to reach people living with HIV who do not know their status and who have high HIV-related risk. Many demand creation strategies have been assessed for how they affect HIV testing uptake and the proportion of people living with HIV diagnosed, including the following.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Evidence-informed platforms for delivering demand creation include:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>peer-led demand creation interventions, including mobilization; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>digital platforms, such as short, prerecorded videos encouraging testing<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>Approaches that have showed evidence of increasing demand include:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>advertising specific attributes of HIV testing services;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>brief key messages and counselling by providers (less than 15 minutes);<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>messages during couples counselling that encourage testing;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>messages related to risk reduction and economic empowerment, especially for people who inject drugs; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>motivational messages.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><\/div>&#13;\n&#13;\n<div class=\"recommend\">&#13;\n<h5>Good practice statement on demand creation (2019) (continued)<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Evidence suggests that the following approaches may be less effective for demand creation:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>personal invitation letters;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>individualized content messaging;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>counselling focused on building the relationship between the client and counsellor\u00b9; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>general text messages, including SMS.<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>Some studies report increases in HIV testing service uptake when incentives are offered, but when the use of incentives for demand creation is considered, the benefits and costs should be carefully weighed, such as:<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>resource sustainability, especially for providing financial incentives, which may undermine the principles of universal health coverage;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>longer-term behavioural changes associating HIV testing services and other services with incentives weighed against short-term increases in uptake;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>negative effects on equity, because some populations and diseases are given priority; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>potential to give lower priority to systematically implementing strategies that improve service delivery and reduce barriers and disincentives, such as user charges associated with accessing health-care services more broadly.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><div class=\"footer\">&#13;\n<div class=\"footer-links\">\u00a0<\/div>&#13;\nSource: <em>Consolidated guidelines on HIV testing services, 2019 (1)<\/em>.<\/div>&#13;\n<\/div>&#13;\n","title":"2.3 Mobilizing demand and pre-test services","nid":482,"vid":2920,"created":1630675964,"changed":1641793517,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content-Menulist","class":"content-menulist"}}
