The recommendation to start ART for all people living with HIV regardless of WHO clinical stage and at any CD4 cell count was based on a systematic review of three randomized trials (START, TEMPRANO and HPTN 052) and 17 observational studies <em>(3).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Costs, cost-effectiveness, equity, acceptability and feasibility<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Initiating ART regardless of CD4 cell count was considered to be cost effective, equitable, acceptable and feasible <em>(3).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Considerations for subpopulations<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><strong>People with advanced HIV disease<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>People with advanced HIV disease should be given priority for initiating ART since they are at high risk of death, particularly if resources are scarce. These people should be evaluated for the risk or presence of opportunistic infections such as TB and cryptococcal meningitis, but ART should be delayed only when meningitis or another central nervous system infection is suspected (see Chapter 5).<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><strong>Pregnant and breastfeeding women<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Providing ART to all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV improves the woman's health outcomes, prevents the mother-to-child transmission of HIV and prevents the transmission of HIV from the woman to a sexual partner. Considering ART has individual health benefits for all adults, the recommendation applies to both breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Women who initiate lifelong ART, especially those with young children, may face considerable challenges in seeking regular HIV care and maintaining adherence to treatment. Efforts to scale up treatment require a holistic approach to women's lives and parallel investments in community-based support to improve women's treatment literacy, preparedness and agency to remain in follow-up and adhere to treatment.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p><strong>Children<\/strong><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Infants and young children living with HIV have a high risk of poor outcomes, with up to 52% of children born with HIV dying before the age of two years in the absence of any intervention <em>(9).<\/em> By five years of age, the risk of mortality and disease progression in the absence of treatment falls to rates similar to those observed among young adults <em>(10,11).<\/em> Improved access to early infant diagnosis has increased the identification of infants living with HIV, but half the children who are eligible for ART are still not being treated, and ART coverage among children living with HIV lags behind that among adults: 53% versus 57% globally in 2020 <em>(6).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Since 2015, WHO has recommended initiating ART for all children with HIV. The recommendation to start ART immediately is conditional for children living with HIV from one to less than 10 years old because of limited evidence supporting ART initiation regardless of the clinical and immune conditions of children <em>(11-13).<\/em> However, initiating ART provides significant programmatic advantages in practice, especially in settings with limited access to immunological testing, a high burden of HIV disease and low ART coverage among children <em>(14).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>As ART is expanded to all children regardless of clinical and immune status, all children younger than five years are considered to have advanced HIV disease (Chapter 5) and should be given priority for treatment because of their higher risk of death and rapid disease progression.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Recently, more emphasis has been put on generating evidence on the early initiation of ART in newborns, with the goal of exploring the role of timing of ART initiation on improving outcomes and limiting the viral reservoir. For newborns, initiation within the first seven days of life results in a fourfold more rapid time to suppression of viral loads compared with initiating between eight and 28 days of life <em>(15).<\/em> Similarly, younger age at ART initiation predicted more rapid suppression of viral loads in a cohort of infants from Europe and Thailand, with perinatal HIV acquisition and treatment initiation at a median of 2.9 months of age (16). Several studies have reported that early treatment of infants with perinatally acquired HIV is also associated with reduced size of viral reservoirs <em>(16-20).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>These studies have provided further support for initiating ART as soon as the diagnosis is made, and when possible, during the first weeks of life, to limit reservoir formation. Treating full-term infants two weeks and younger and preterm infants is complex because of the limited data on the pharmacokinetics and appropriate dosing of ARV drugs in this age group; this area is being actively investigated <em>(21).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Research gaps<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Adolescents and young women living with HIV face unique challenges in preventing the transmission of HIV to their children and attending to their own health needs, including poor access to reproductive health services, poor uptake of testing and poor retention in care. Operational research is urgently needed to identify the drivers of poor outcomes among adolescents to define how to provide adolescent-friendly maternal and newborn health services and to develop specific strategies to improve retention in care.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Although ART during pregnancy and breastfeeding provides clear public health benefits in terms of maternal health and preventing transmission to the child, the potential occurrence of adverse effects of ART (especially ART use during the preconception period) on pregnancy outcome and whether these adverse effects differ between ART regimens require further research. In addition, the potential long-term effects of fetal and infant exposure to maternal drugs are not fully understood. The overall risk of congenital birth defects appears to be similar to that of the general population for the currently recommended first-line ARV drugs; for newer drugs this remains an important topic for investigation.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Optimal service delivery models to ensure rapid identification and ART initiation among infants and children and strategies to provide an integrated package of care to reduce children's overall mortality are also needed. For example, the integration of ARV drug delivery in antenatal care and maternal, neonatal and childcare services (as opposed to referral to ART clinics) requires further implementation and assessment.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Significant knowledge gaps remain about the timing of ART initiation and the optimal ART regimen for newborns and how ART initiation in the neonatal period can be safely operationalized in the context of other competing priorities, lack of pharmacokinetic data for dosing of more optimal drug regimens and lack of appropriate training for frontline care providers.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"4.4 When to start ART","nid":518,"vid":2211,"created":1631628804,"changed":1631715680,"field_content_type":{"tid":1,"name":"Content","class":"content"}}
