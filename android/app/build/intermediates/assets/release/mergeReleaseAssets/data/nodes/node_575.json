Injecting drug use is associated with a range of diseases and infections, including HIV, viral hepatitis, TB, septicaemia and bacterial endocarditis.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>WHO, UNODC and UNAIDS recommend a comprehensive package of interventions for HIV prevention, treatment and care for people who inject drugs, including needle and syringe programmes, opioid substitution therapy, HIV testing and counselling, ART, preventing and treating sexually transmitted infections, condom programmes, preventing and treating viral hepatitis and preventing, diagnosing and treating TB. More recently, WHO updated this package to include community distribution of naloxone to manage opioid overdose as well as a set of enabling interventions to overcome the structural barriers for people who use drugs and other key populations to access these health interventions. These enabling interventions include revising laws and legislation that criminalize the consumption and possession of drugs and address violence, stigma and discrimination in health-care settings.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Although the focus with HIV has been injecting opioids, a link is becoming more evident between using other drugs such as amphetamine-like stimulants and sexual risk and transmission of HIV <em>(214,355,356,357).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>A form of sexualized drug use often referred to as chemsex risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, including HCV transmission.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"6.12 Drug use","nid":575,"vid":2880,"created":1632149798,"changed":1640196608,"field_content_type":{"tid":1,"name":"Content","class":"content"}}
