Although chronic HIV care settings provide an opportunity to detect and manage depression among people living with HIV, it is often overlooked and unrecognized by health\u00adcare providers. Treatment or lack of treatment for mental health disorders can affect general health, adherence to ARV drugs and retention in care and may lead to potential side-effects and drug-drug interactions being overlooked <em>(201,204-207).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The <em>mhGAP intervention guide for mental, neurological and substance use disorders in non-specialized health settings: Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), version 2 (208)<\/em> provides evidence-informed comprehensive guidelines on the diagnosis and management of a range of mental, nervous system and substance use disorders, including developmental and behavioural disorders among children and adolescents, with a focus on nine priority mental health conditions, including diagnosing and managing people with depression. Key updates include a simplified clinical assessment algorithm for follow-up and the inclusion of new modules; an implementation module of necessary infrastructure and resources and revised modules on psychoses, behavioural disorders, disorders caused by substance use and child and adolescent mental health <em>(208).<\/em> Implementing mhGAP through primary care would improve the detection and management of depression among adults compared with standard-of-care approaches <em>(209).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>A systematic review conducted to support the guideline update in 2015 aimed to determine whether routine screening and management of depression (specifically with mhGAP criteria) improve ART adherence and treatment outcomes among people living with HIV <em>(51,208).<\/em> No studies were identified explicitly reporting on mhGAP for this specific population.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Indirect evidence from a systematic review on the accuracy of using screening tools to identify depression among people living with HIV in all settings identified 18 studies, using 25 different screening instruments, compared with criterion standards for diagnosing depression <em>(51,208).<\/em> Multiple index test and criterion standards were assessed, and the review evaluated each test's area under the curve as a summary measure of accuracy (area under the curve above 0.9 is considered to be highly accurate; 0.7 to 0.9 to be moderately accurate; and 0.51 to 0.69 to be of low accuracy) <em>(207).<\/em> Although several instruments showed very good or even excellent performance diagnosing depression among people living with HIV, the overall certainty of evidence is very low. The Guideline Development Group, considering acceptability and feasibility from end-users and lack of harm, made a conditional recommendation.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Although depression is more common among people living with HIV than in the general population, there is less consistent and limited evidence to show that managing depression improves HIV treatment outcomes. However, management of depression improves the mental health and general well-being of people living with HIV.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The limited data on HIV and mental health service delivery models indicate that integration supports efficiency and does not increase the costs of care. A narrative review from sub-Saharan Africa suggests that integrating mental health care into existing health systems is an effective and cost-efficient approach to expand access to mental health services for people living with HIV in resource-limited settings <em>(210).<\/em> There is also an ongoing study on the cost-effectiveness of screening and treating people living with HIV for depression in sub-Saharan Africa <em>(211).<\/em> However, more evidence is needed on effective models of integrating HIV and mental health services in various settings <em>(212).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>A survey of national HIV programme managers found that 38% of respondents reported that mental health screening is performed in some HIV care settings with referral for treatment when indicated <em>(51).<\/em> Forty-three per cent did not have mental health screening and treatment available for people living with HIV. None of the countries reported countrywide implementation of mental health screening and treatment services in all HIV care settings. The top three challenges identified by programme managers for integrating mental health services in HIV care settings are shortage of human resources, skills and capacity of health-care providers and lack of funding. WHO estimates that up to 85% of people with severe mental disorders and 56% of people with depression in low- and middle-income countries do not have access to treatment <em>(213).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Implementation considerations<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Screening for depression may support adherence to ART, retention in care, suppression of viral loads and improve quality of life and, if implemented, depression should be managed according to national standards or mhGAP. Integration or linkage to the mental health services should be implemented in the settings in which health-care infrastructure and trained human resources are available. Implementing treatment for depression among people living with HIV may require task sharing, building health-care worker capacity, national adaptation of screening tools and simplifying tools for use by non-specialized primary care providers.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Research gaps<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>There are several research gaps related to screening and treating people living with HIV for mental health disorders and depression:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>the accuracy of current estimates of HIV and depression because of the wide variability in reports, with packages of care for common mental disorders likely to be most effective among people living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries;<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>the long-term impact of depression interventions in relation to HIV outcomes; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>the optimal time-points for mental health interventions.<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul>","title":"6.11 Mental health among people living with HIV","nid":574,"vid":2466,"created":1632149627,"changed":1632226863,"field_content_type":{"tid":1,"name":"Content","class":"content"}}
