{"body":"<p>In June 2020, WHO published a technical update that outlined the key recommended indicators and approaches and tools for monitoring ARV drug toxicity <em>(3).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The transition to DTG as the preferred first-line ART is an opportunity to optimize and standardize HIV treatment, but it also poses certain risks, such as the potential for new types of drug-related toxicity and suboptimal treatment outcomes. Recent data suggest a potential risk of weight gain associated with newer ARV drugs (notably DTG and TAF) and highlight the need for active toxicity monitoring in countries as they scale up or introduce these drugs <em>(4).<\/em> The signal of neural tube defect potentially associated with DTG in May 2018 reinforced the importance of robust data and surveillance systems to evaluate the safety of new ARV drugs for pregnant women and their unborn children in low- and middle-income countries <em>(5).<\/em> WHO recommends that countries consider a combination of approaches to monitor ARV drug toxicity and promote patient safety, including surveillance of maternal, fetal and neonatal safety of ARV drugs used in pregnancy and active and routine toxicity monitoring in all populations, including adults, adolescents and children <em>(6-8).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n","title":"8.6 Monitoring ARV drug toxicity","nid":626,"vid":2741,"created":1632393966,"changed":1632909460,"field_content_type":{"tid":2,"name":"Content-Menulist","class":"content-menulist"}}
