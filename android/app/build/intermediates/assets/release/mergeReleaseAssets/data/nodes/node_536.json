{"body":"<p>The Guideline Development Group assessed the benefits and risks of using DTG at the time of conception in 2018 and in 2019, reviewing the latest data from Botswana and other countries as well as from modelling the population-level risks and benefits of DTG use among women of childbearing potential as a result of a signal reported in 2018 <em>(84).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The risk of neural tube defects associated with DTG use at the time of conception in the Tsepamo study has progressively declined since the initial report released in May 2018; the rate of neural tube defects appears to have stabilized at 0.19% since September 2019 and is no longer statistically significant when comparing the prevalence of neural tube defects between preconception DTG and preconception non-DTG ART groups <em>(221-223)<\/em> (Box 4.7). Other adverse pregnancy outcomes (miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age and neonatal mortality) were not increased with maternal DTG compared with EFV-containing regimens when the regimens were started preconception or during pregnancy <em>(221,222).<\/em> There is a continued need to monitor the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with the use of DTG and other new ARV drugs, and several studies are ongoing to address this <em>(83,223-225).<\/em> A woman-centred and a rights-based approach should be applied to ART delivery. Concern about the risk of neural tube defects and other pregnancy outcomes has highlighted the importance of both access to reproductive health services, including contraceptives, for women and adolescent girls living with HIV and the importance of the rights of women and adolescent girls living with HIV to make informed choices about their health, including their sexual and reproductive health and choice of ART (see Box 4.2).<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<div class=\"new_recommend \">&#13;\n<h5><strong>Box 4.7.<\/strong> Updates on the risk of neural tube defects among infants born to women receiving DTG before conception or early in pregnancy<h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<\/h5><\/h5><p>The Tsepamo study, a large observational study of birth outcomes that started in 2014 in Botswana, reported in May 2018 a potential association between DTG use and an increased risk of neural tube defects among infants born to the women who were taking DTG at the time of conception. In August 2018, the WHO Advisory Committee on Safety of Medical Products set up a subcommittee on DTG to review all available evidence.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>At the last 17th Advisory Committee meeting (27-29 October 2020), data from the Tsepamo study of birth outcomes from May 2018 to April 2020 and other studies were reviewed. The prevalence of neural tube defects with preconception DTG decreased from 0.94% in May 2018 to 0.30% in March 2019 and to 0.19% in April 2020 <em>(222).<\/em> The prevalence of neural tube defects among infants born to mothers receiving preconception non-DTG regimens remained similar at all time points, between 0.10% and 0.12%; with preconception EFV between 0.05% and 0.07%; and among HIV-uninfected women 0.07% to 0.09%. The difference in the prevalence of neural tube between preconception DTG and preconception non-DTG ART, which was statistically significantly in May 2018 and March 2019, is no longer statistically significant (prevalence difference 0.09%, 95% CI -0.03 and 0.30), although the difference is still borderline higher when the prevalence with preconception DTG is compared with preconception EFV and HIV-uninfected women <em>(222).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The risk of neural tube defects with preconception DTG in the Tsepamo study, should it persist with further increase in the numbers of exposures, appears to be about 0.2% or less, a potential excess of only one neural tube defect per 1000 DTG exposures at conception compared with a general population prevalence of 0.06% in countries with food folate fortification to 0.10% in countries without food folate fortification <em>(226,227).<\/em> Two separate risk-benefit analyses indicate that the benefits of first-line DTG-based ART compared with EFV-based ART among individuals living with HIV, including women of childbearing potential, significantly outweigh the potential risks <em>(103,228).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>WHO strongly supports continuing birth surveillance studies such as the Tsepamo Botswana study, not only to provide a definitive answer to the question of a neural tube defects signal but as a general model for studying the safety of drugs in pregnancy. WHO will update these data and provide additional information as it becomes available.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>WHO continues to monitor safety and efficacy data in pregnancy as DTG is scaled up in countries, such as studies in Botswana and Brazil and updates from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry <em>(225,229,230).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>WHO recommends both folic acid and iron supplementation for pregnant women, including pregnant women living with HIV, to prevent maternal anaemia, puerperal sepsis, low birth weight and preterm birth <em>(130).<\/em> The potential protective effects of folic acid supplementation for women of childbearing potential receiving DTG and who wish to become pregnant has not yet been established, but folic acid and iron supplementation during pregnancy have an important role in improving pregnancy outcomes overall.<\/p>&#13;\n<\/div>&#13;\n","title":"4.8.2 Safety of DTG during pregnancy","nid":536,"vid":2309,"created":1631629211,"changed":1631807815,"field_content_type":{"tid":1,"name":"Content","class":"content"}}
