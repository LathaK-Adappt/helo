{"body":"<p>In 2016, WHO strongly recommended initiating ART for all adults living with HIV regardless of WHO clinical stage and at any CD4 cell count. This \"treat-all\" recommendation has resulted in the scale-up of ART in more than 130 countries globally, accompanied by increased levels of availability of treatment monitoring. Treatment scale-up was further strengthened with the recommendation on rapid ART initiation in 2017, which promotes the initiation of ART within seven days of HIV diagnosis and the offer of same-day ART start. People with advanced HIV disease should be given priority for clinical assessment and treatment initiation\u00a0<em>(1,2). <\/em> This chapter summarizes the recommendations and supporting evidence. It also includes other key recommendations and information on the timing of ART, other coinfections, first-, second- and third-line regimens, known types of ARV drug toxicity and updates to the risk of neural tube defects in the periconceptional use of DTG.
