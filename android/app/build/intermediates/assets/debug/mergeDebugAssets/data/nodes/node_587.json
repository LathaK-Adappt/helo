The review identified 15 studies describing intervention strategies including adults, adolescents <em>(72)<\/em> and children and the following key population groups: sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender people and people who inject drugs.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<div class=\"new_recommend \">&#13;\n<h5><strong>Box 7.2<\/strong> Interventions to improve relationships between patients and health-care providers<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Interventions that were found to improve relationships between patients and health\u00adcare providers could be classified into the following approaches:<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>providing friendly and welcoming services:<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>- such as through training providers to make general HIV services more welcoming, providing adolescent-friendly services outside school hours and training providers to welcome patients back into care;<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>conducting sensitization training for clinical and non-clinical health-care providers to improve care for key populations:<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>- both at the primary care and community levels, which includes issues related to stigma and discrimination;<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>offering individualized adherence counselling and patient-centred communication:<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>- such as shared decision-making and planning for ART initiation and adherence and supporting change in provider attitudes towards those who have disengaged from care;<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<ul><li>facilitating client education in empowerment and communication skills; and<\/li>&#13;\n\t<li>providing feedback to health-care workers on patient concerns and evaluation of service quality:<\/li>&#13;\n<\/ul><p>- such as community score cards, patient feedback mechanisms combined with quality improvement exercises.<\/p>&#13;\n<\/div>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Overall, studies reported beneficial effects of these approaches across the HIV cascade including improved ART uptake, adherence and suppression of viral loads.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The Guideline Development Group formulated a new good practice considering the indirect evidence showing that a health system-based perspective and providing a variety of people-centred practices will improve relationships between patients and health-care providers. Providing tools to improve people-centred services may reduce stigma, discrimination and violence against people living with HIV, especially among women, transgender people and other vulnerable groups. Health-care providers should be trained appropriately to ensure that, in addition to improving relationships with patients, they are also capable of supporting women and vulnerable groups in responding to gender or intimate partner violence and in accessing sexual health counselling and support.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"7.4 People-centred care","nid":587,"vid":3003,"created":1632228112,"changed":1694158606,"field_content_type":{"tid":1,"name":"Content","class":"content"}}
