{"body":"<p>Building on the toxicity monitoring efforts at the country level, WHO has developed a central database for the surveillance of the safety of new ARV drugs for adults, adolescents and children. The goals of the database are to facilitate the pooling of safety data collected by countries and partners, to increase sample sizes, to generate more rapid evidence on the safety profile of new ARV drugs and to detect toxicity signals.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>WHO has established a similar collaborative initiative to generate data on the safety of drugs in pregnancy through a central registry for epidemiological surveillance of drug safety in pregnancy.
