{"body":"<p>Optimizing the safety and tolerability of ARV drug regimens for treating adolescents, children and neonates living with HIV is critical to ensuring durability of treatment and quality of care. An updated systematic review conducted in 2021 confirms that DTG has a good tolerability profile with no drug discontinuation, no grade 3 or 4 or adverse drug reactions and no deaths reported across the studies in which DTG was used as first-line ART <em>(99,237).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In particular, a randomized controlled trial investigating the use of DTG versus the standard of care showed better lipid profile (with lower total cholesterol) and marginal increase in weight, height and BMI at 96 weeks. To date, programme data from countries where rapid transition to DTG is occurring have not reported any toxicity or tolerability concerned <em>(127,128). <\/em>Although all these findings are very reassuring, the use of DTG is still relatively limited, and routine active monitoring is needed as good practice for all new ARV drugs in these populations.<\/p>","title":"4.8.4 Monitoring the toxicity of ARV drugs among adolescents, children and neonates","nid":538,"vid":2244,"created":1631629243,"changed":1631722991,"field_content_type":{"tid":1,"name":"Content","class":"content"}}
