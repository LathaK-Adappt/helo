Many of these infections are asymptomatic, especially among women <em>(220).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Substantial evidence indicates that sexually transmitted infections increase HIV transmissibility and the risk of acquiring HIV by as much as 2-3 times in some populations <em>(221,222).<\/em> It has also been shown that infection with <em>N. gonorrhoeae<\/em> substantially increases shedding of HIV-1 from the male genital tract in seminal fluid <em>(223).<\/em> Genital herpes (HSV-2) almost triples the risk of acquiring HIV for both men and women <em>(224,225).<\/em> HIV increases the infectiousness and severity of sexually transmitted infections <em>(226).<\/em> HIV-seropositive women are at high risk of infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), including oncogenic HPV types <em>(227).<\/em> To reduce HIV transmission and optimize sexual and reproductive health, sexually transmitted infections need to be diagnosed and treated as a priority (228). Efforts should therefore be taken to strengthen sexually transmitted infection prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>In a systematic review, the median prevalence of sexually transmitted infections among people living with HIV was 12.4%. The most common sexually transmitted infections were syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis <em>(229).<\/em> Modelling has estimated that 10% of the cases in which gay men and other men who have sex with men acquire HIV are attributable to increased susceptibility because of <em>N. gonorrhoeae<\/em> or <em>C. trachomatis<\/em> infection <em>(230).<\/em> Reports in many settings indicate high sexually transmitted infection prevalence among users of PrEP at baseline screening and high incidence while taking PrEP. The reports also include high rates of gonorrhoea, especially among men who have sex with men <em>(231).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>For people living with HIV, a holistic and comprehensive approach to sexual and reproductive health and rights includes appropriate sexually transmitted infection services. People living with HIV should be screened and treated for sexually transmitted infections. Men who have sex with men and transgender people with symptomatic sexually transmitted infections should seek and be offered syndromic management and treatment, in line with existing WHO guidance.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Management<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Symptomatic cases should either be managed syndromically and where feasible, etiological diagnosis obtained <em>(218).<\/em> To prevent future sexually transmitted infections, the promotion and provision of safer sex practices, including condom use, should be reenforced. Appropriate sexually transmitted infection treatment, including partner management, should be ensured. For people who have urethral discharge, vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, anorectal discharge or genital ulcer, WHO recommends management based on the results of quality-assured molecular assays. However, in settings with limited or no molecular tests or laboratory capacity, WHO recommend syndromic treatment to ensure treatment on the same day of the visit. Specific recommendations are available for each syndrome <em>(232).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h6><strong>Sexually transmitted infection treatment for sex workers, men who have sex with men and transgender people<\/strong><\/h6>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Anorectal symptoms and anorectal sexually transmitted infections are prevalent among who engage in anal sexual intercourse. Asymptomatic anorectal infections are not uncommon, although precise data are scarce. The people at highest risk of asymptomatic anorectal infections are men who have sex with men, male and female sex workers, transgender people and women who have had receptive anal intercourse with men with sexually transmitted infections. For syndromic diagnosis and management, these infections have been grouped under anorectal infections. Anorectal infections may be associated with anorectal pain, itching, discharge, bleeding, sensation of rectal fullness, tenesmus, constipation and mucus streaking of stools.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Recommendations for the treatment of syphilis among pregnant women and of congenital syphilis have been previously published, updated in 2016 <em>(233)<\/em> and reprinted in 2017 <em>(217).<\/em><\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Implementation considerations<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>A key approach to increasing the coverage of sexually transmitted infection services for people living with HIV is integration or linkage of these services within HIV care and treatment settings <em>(51).<\/em> It is necessary to promptly adopt service delivery models that integrate a people-centred approach to address sexually transmitted infections among people living with HIV.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>Integration and linkage between HIV and sexual and reproductive health services require approaches that engage those at greatest risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections in any interventions and programmes. This will increase access to appropriate testing, linkage to treatment and further strengthening of preventive services. Frequently, stigma and discrimination result in reduced health-seeking behaviour, delaying diagnosis and effective partner notification and, consequently, impeding public health efforts to control the sexually transmitted infection and HIV epidemics. Health-care providers providing HIV prevention and treatment services need to provide culturally competent and sensitive sexually transmitted infection care, so that vulnerable populations seek clinical services more readily.<\/p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<h5>Research gaps<\/h5>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>The challenge for researchers, clinicians and public health officials is to understand how best to promote sexual health <em>(234).<\/em> The improvements in HIV treatment, diagnostic capabilities for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections and educational digital media create new challenges and opportunities for key stakeholders, including civil society, to limit the spread of sexually transmitted infections while respecting individual decisions about sexual expression.<\/p>&#13;\n","title":"6.13 Sexually transmitted infections","nid":576,"vid":2884,"created":1632149858,"changed":1640196938,"field_content_type":{"tid":1,"name":"Content","class":"content"}}
